**User:**  
Use r code to clean this data and add labels if needed.  
Show the code to me.  

**Assistant:**  
Based on the preview of the data, I'll clean the data and add meaningful labels where needed. Here's what will be done:

1. Standardize column names by replacing dots or unconventional symbols with underscores.  
2. Ensure proper labeling of columns where necessary.  
3. Remove unnecessary spaces in column names or values if present.

Here is the R code to perform these tasks:

```r
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("path_to_file/raw_data.csv")

# Clean column names
clean_data <- data %>%
  rename(
    id = X_id,
    date = date.mmm.yy.,
    population_group = population_group,
    returned_from_housing = returned_from_housing,
    returned_to_shelter = returned_to_shelter,
    newly_identified = newly_identified,
    moved_to_housing = moved_to_housing,
    became_inactive = became_inactive,
    actively_homeless = actively_homeless,
    age_under_16 = ageunder16,
    age_16_24 = age16.24,
    age_25_34 = age25.34,
    age_35_44 = age35.44,
    age_45_54 = age45.54,
    age_55_64 = age55.64,
    age_65_over = age65over,
    gender_male = gender_male,
    gender_female = gender_female,
    gender_transgender_non_binary_or_two_spirit = gender_transgender.non.binary_or_two_spirit,
    population_group_percentage = population_group_percentage
  )

# Convert percentage column to numeric by removing the percentage sign
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(population_group_percentage = as.numeric(gsub("%", "", population_group_percentage)))

# Display the cleaned data
head(clean_data)
```

This R code will clean and standardize your data, making it easier to analyze. Let me know if you need further modifications.

**User:**  
Then use the clean data to analyze and do some plotting graphs using R Studio.

**Assistant:**  
Once you have cleaned the data using the previous R script, you can proceed with analysis and visualizations. Below is some example R code that will help you analyze the data and create some visualizations.

### 1. Install and Load Required Libraries

```r
# Install necessary packages (if not installed)
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")

# Load the libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

### 2. Data Exploration

Before plotting, you can take a look at the structure and summary of the data:

```r
# Check the structure of the cleaned data
str(clean_data)

# Summary statistics
summary(clean_data)
```

### 3. Analysis and Plotting

#### a. Plot 1: Active Homeless Population Over Time

```r
# Convert 'date' column to Date format
clean_data$date <- as.Date(paste0("01-", clean_data$date), format="%d-%b-%y")

# Plot active homeless population over time
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless, group = population_group, color = population_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Active Homeless Population Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Active Homeless Population",
       color = "Population Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### b. Plot 2: Distribution of Population by Gender

```r
# Summarize gender data
gender_data <- clean_data %>%
  select(population_group, gender_male, gender_female, gender_transgender_non_binary_or_two_spirit) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("gender"), names_to = "gender", values_to = "count")

# Plot gender distribution by population group
ggplot(gender_data, aes(x = population_group, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution by Population Group",
       x = "Population Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

#### c. Plot 3: Age Distribution Across Population Groups

```r
# Summarize age data
age_data <- clean_data %>%
  select(population_group, age_under_16, age_16_24, age_25_34, age_35_44, age_45_54, age_55_64, age_65_over) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("age"), names_to = "age_group", values_to = "count")

# Plot age distribution across population groups
ggplot(age_data, aes(x = population_group, y = count, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution Across Population Groups",
       x = "Population Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Age Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### 4. Save the Cleaned Data (Optional)

If you want to save the cleaned data for future use:

```r
write.csv(clean_data, "cleaned_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

These graphs will help you visualize trends, distributions, and patterns within the data. You can modify these plots or create additional ones depending on your specific analysis needs. Let me know if you'd like to explore something further!

**User:**  
Draw Bar Plot of Actively Homeless Population by Group.

**Assistant:**  
Here is an R code to create a bar plot of the actively homeless population by group using `ggplot2`:

### R Code:

```r
# Install and load ggplot2 if not installed
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies=TRUE)
library(ggplot2)

# Bar plot of actively homeless population by population group
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = population_group, y = actively_homeless, fill = population_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Actively Homeless Population by Group",
       x = "Population Group",
       y = "Actively Homeless Population") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # Rotate x-axis labels
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3", guide = FALSE) # Optional: color scheme
```

### Explanation:
- **`aes(x = population_group, y = actively_homeless, fill = population_group)`**: Specifies that the x-axis will represent population groups and the y-axis will represent the actively homeless population. The `fill` parameter colors the bars by population group.
- **`geom_bar(stat = "identity")`**: Creates the bar plot using the actual values of the data.
- **`theme_minimal()`**: Applies a clean, minimal theme to the plot.
- **`axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)`**: Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.
- **`scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3", guide = FALSE)`**: Adds a color palette for the bars (optional).

This bar plot will display the actively homeless population for each population group. You can modify the labels or styling as needed. Let me know if you need any further modifications!

**User:**  
For "a. Plot 1: Active Homeless Population Over Time", I want you to make the graph more colourful and beautiful.

**Assistant:**  
To make the graph more colorful and visually appealing, we can enhance the plot by adding custom color palettes, adjusting line thickness, and tweaking other styling options.

Here's an updated version of the code for "Active Homeless Population Over Time" with enhancements to make the graph more colorful and beautiful:

### Updated R Code:

```r
# Install and load necessary libraries if not already installed
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies=TRUE)
if (!require(scales)) install.packages("scales", dependencies=TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

# Convert 'date' column to Date format (if not already done)
clean_data$date <- as.Date(paste0("01-", clean_data$date), format="%d-%b-%y")

# Create a colorful and visually appealing plot
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = date, y = actively_homeless, group = population_group, color = population_group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +                       # Thicker lines for better visibility
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +           # Add points for better aesthetics
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(unique(clean_data$population_group)))) + # Use rainbow palette for vibrant colors
  labs(title = "Active Homeless Population Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Active Homeless Population",
       color = "Population Group") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +               # Use a minimal theme with a larger base font size

Sure! Here's the entire conversation from start to finish in plain text:

### Conclusion:
1. **Actively Homeless Population by Group**: Most of the homeless population falls under "All Population," followed by significant groups like "Chronic" and "Refugees."
2. **Age Distribution**: Youth and Families have a significant portion of younger individuals, while Chronic homelessness affects more middle-aged individuals.
3. **Gender Distribution**: Males dominate the homeless population, with a smaller but notable transgender/non-binary group.
4. **Housing Trends**: There is a gap between newly identified individuals and those housed, signaling a need for enhanced housing programs.

---

**User**: can you match some of these conclusions with the graphs you plot?

**Assistant**:
Matched conclusions with graphs:

- **Bar Plot of Actively Homeless Population by Group**: Largest portion in the "All Population" category, with significant numbers in "Chronic" and "Refugees."
- **Stacked Bar Plot of Age Distribution**: Shows younger individuals in the Families and Refugees groups, while middle-aged people dominate the Chronic group.
- **Pie Chart of Gender Distribution**: Visualizes the gender imbalance.
- **Line Plot of Newly Identified vs Moved to Housing**: Displays the gap between newly identified individuals and those housed.

**User**: Error in data$population_group : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable for the Bar graph

**Assistant**: 
Suggested renaming the `data` object to avoid conflict with the internal R `data()` function, and provided a fix:

```r
homeless_data <- read.csv("raw_data.csv")
ggplot(homeless_data, aes(x = population_group, y = actively_homeless, fill = population_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Actively Homeless Population by Group", x = "Population Group", y = "Actively Homeless") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

---

**User**: 
```{r}
#| label: tbl-cleaned-data
#| tbl-cap: Sample of cleaned lead data 
#| echo: false

  kable(
    col.names = c("Sample Date", "Partial Postal Code", "Lead Concentration (ppb)"),
    booktabs = TRUE
    )
```

**Assistant**: 
Explanation of the code and suggested a similar format for the actively homeless population:

```r
library(knitr)
actively_homeless_data <- homeless_data %>%
  select(population_group, actively_homeless)

head(actively_homeless_data, 6) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Population Group", "Actively Homeless Population"),
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

---

**User**: generate a similar one for this data

**Assistant**: 
Loaded the new file and displayed the structure. Provided the following R code to display a clean table of the "actively homeless" population:
